            synopsis: "Hold down Alt + J on an Apple keyboard and you get Δ, the Greek letter ‘delta’. Mathematicians and physicists use this symbol to denote change. One might say that alt-J do something similar with pop history. The British trio picks the best moments of the last sixty years and subverts them within their own universe. They are just as committed and inventive as Sigur Rós or The xx. Their fairytale world is clearly at home at Werchter. As Humo wrote of their first appearance in 2013: ‘How much excruciating beauty can one person take, and how much sugary emotion? Alt-J changed your life in The Barn.’ And as Moustique witnessed in 2015: ‘Alt-J joins the big league.’ There has been a promising silence around the group since their last tour in 2017 …",

Nothing came of it. But that moment of excitement and longing had a strong influence on her music from then on, says the Norwegian in her twenties. And she also had a readymade name for the songs she wrote in her bedroom on the guitar her grandfather had given her for her birthday when she was a teenager. Her first single ‘I Wanna Be Your Girlfriend’ was considered one of the best songs of 2018. It expressed the aspirations of many of her contemporaries and turned Ringheim into a beacon for the LGBT community. That may seem weighty but her songs are nimble and humorous, first and foremost. Her debut album ‘World In Red’ comes out in October.",

Some of the headlines: ‘So much grandeur’. ‘An infectious carnival’. ‘Dancing towards a better world’. Shortly afterwards, Albarn announced that we shouldn’t expect too much over the next ten years. Then in January this year, they presented the musical concept ‘Song Machine’. And next year, the first virtual band in history is heading back out on tour. From now on, Gorillaz will release music in episodes, whenever new material is ready. Each episode features a different guest:  in 2020 the likes of slowthai, Fatoumata Diaware, Peter Hook (New Order), Georgia and Octavian joined forces with the band.",

In 2002 the – then – weekly NME magazine wrote the following prophetic words about Original Pirate Music, the debut album by The Streets. ‘Everybody knows that the future of dance music is on the streets. Now the future of dance music is The Streets.’ Skinner took social commentary and the street sound of the day – two-step and garage – and pressed them into a filthy, poetic mosaic. A hooligan in poet’s clothing. The next album A Grand Don’t Come For Free (2004) brought the hits Fit But You Know It and Dry Your Eyes. In 2011, Skinner shut up shop to work on films. But the good stuff always comes round again. His recent appearances at the AB and Pukkelpop – with an incredible band in tow – were right up there.",

Drummer Ben Thatcher picked him up at the airport, and on the way home they decided to start a band. They played their first gig the very next day. Royal Blood produce a delicious kind of noise that has been compared to Queens of The Stone Age and The White Stripes. They were catapulted into the limelight when Arctic Monkeys drummer Matt Helders wore one of the band’s t-shirts on stage at Glastonbury 2013. Next, they were selected for BBC Sound Of 2014, the annual list of promising artists drawn up by members of the UK music press. A review of their previous Werchter appearance in 2017 said, ‘Royal Blood played the main stage to smithereens’. This is the pair’s fifth time.",

            synopsis: "Imagine soul singer Sam Cooke and proto-rocker Neil Young in the Wu-Tang Clan hip hop collective. That should give you a rough idea of Black Pumas, a project run by an extraordinary duo from Austin, Texas. Adrian Quesada is in his forties and was once the guitarist for the nine-piece band Grupo Fantasma, winners of the Grammy for Best Latin Album in 2010. Quesada had a few instrumental tracks in his studio that were crying out for a soulful voice. Some friends recommended Eric Burton, a busker from downtown Austin, and the rest is history. The Black Pumas’ debut is just about flawless. Its psychedelic soul earned the two musicians the title of ‘breakout band of 2019’ in the US. Great stuff for anyone who has enjoyed Alabama Shakes, Durand Jones & The Indications or Curtis Harding at Werchter in recent years.",

Around the world ‘Ho Hey’ dominated the charts for a seriously long time - in the US alone it clocked up 62 weeks and five million copies. The reason for that success, people say, is the authenticity of The Lumineers. Acoustic instruments, cuddly people, brilliant anthems. But their cheerful banjo pop also has depth to it. Drummer Jeremiah Fraites’ brother Josh was guitarist Wesley Schutz’s best friend. When Josh died of an overdose in 2002, Jeremiah and Wesley found solace in the music they created together. At home in America today, The Lumineers are a stalwart, and Jack White has declared himself to be a fan. The excellent album ‘III’ (2019) should rekindle the European connection.",

            synopsis: "‘Dublin in the rain is mine. A pregnant city with a catholic mind’. Those are the first two lines of ‘Dogrel’ (2019), the most hyped Irish rock debut for many a year. Fontaines D.C. aim to make music that sounds like Dublin feels. Like Lou Reed and The Smiths did with New York and Manchester respectively. The D.C. in the name stands for Dublin City, by the way. The raw production and pounding rhythms evoke the wet cobblestones, the never-ending nightlife in the pubs and the buzz of the waking city in the many early-morning markets. Fontaines D.C. are afraid that this fragile world is being devoured by the modern era. This is why they combine their furious punk rock with romantic references to James Joyce and W.B. Yeats, the great Irish poets. Their second album, ‘A Hero’s Death’ will be released on July 31st.",

            synopsis: "An infectious and cheery country group from the wide open prairies of Canada. However, The Dead South started out as a rough and ready grunge band. Nate Hiltes and Danny Kenyon, however, soon tired of all that noise. They convinced two friends to learn to play mandolin and banjo. The four of them turned to bluegrass, the folk music of immigrants in the south-eastern United States. The Dead South inject the genre with humour. On one hand they are in love with the music, while on the other they like to laugh about it. The result sounds like the drunken cousins of Mumford & Sons. These modern hillbillies have developed into a popular party band, with their own dance moves. However, there is a darker edge to them. The merriment disguises their stories of despair and deceit. They are beautiful stories, though.",
